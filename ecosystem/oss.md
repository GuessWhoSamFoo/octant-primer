# Open Source

A defining characteristic of Octant is being an open source project. Despite owned by VMware, one of Octant's core goals is to have an active community involved in the development process and eventually to form governance through third party groups such as the CNCF.

It may seen strange for an enterpise company to pay developers to build a project that is given out for free. However, we can see why this strategy is profitable in the case of Google open sourcing Kubernetes. Even though competitors now have access to the same technology, Kubernetes became the industry standard and Google sells cloud products rather than racing to the bottom with server costs.

The case is similar with VMware. If you are familiar with The Container Store, the value proposition is not in the plastic containers - it lies within selling the idea of being organized. VMware is selling developer productivity to organizations on the same token through open source.
