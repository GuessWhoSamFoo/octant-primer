# Ecosystem

When considering what Octant is supposed to do, it is important to remember it is only a small piece of a much larger workflow. The [CNCF Landscape](https://landscape.cncf.io/) is often used as an initial test to scare off less motivated engineers.

Some parts of the landscape might be abstracted away over time while others grow more important. Octant's role is geared towards developers. In fact, most developers are not going to know about the majority of items on that landscape. The end goal is then to maximize productivity without having to know those details.
