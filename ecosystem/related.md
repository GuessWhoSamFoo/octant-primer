Since Octant's initial release on Github, there has been a number of dashboard projects in the Kubernetes space. A common mistake is associating all these projects under the same umbrella because they all appear to have some form of a dashboard in common. Generally a good approach is to figure out what problem is the tool trying to solve and who is it aimed at.

Below is a list (in no particular order), that range from applications running in the terminal via ncurses to desktop applications.

When browsing through these projects, look for answers to some of these questions.
 - How does it authenticate with the cluster?
 - Does this project see active development?
 - Do users need to learn a new tool or concept?
 - Is it single or multi-cluster?

> Note multi-cluster can also also be ambiguous depending on the context. A tool that is capable of connecting to multiple clusters is not the same as showing information across clusters at the same time.
