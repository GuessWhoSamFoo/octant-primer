# Resource Viewer

The resource viewer is a graph of how object in Kubernetes are related. There is no equivalent of this feature using `kubectl`.

Each node in the graph represents an object. Clicking a deployment will show a list of pods. Nodes can be dragged around. The color of each node can change from green to yellow or red depending on the object's status.
