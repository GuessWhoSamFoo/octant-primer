# Getting Started

> This book aims to be guide for understanding the motivations behind why Octant was built. It encourages a hands-on approach of working with the software along with notes on forward looking ideas.

Octant can be summarized as an extensible dashboard for Kubernetes with a focus for developers. A myraid of phrases have been attempted so far: standard Kubernetes toolkit, augmented kubectl, VScode for Kubernetes, etc. (Kubernetes IDE is a good one, but that's already taken.)

The simplest way to think about Octant is a platform for organizing Kubernetes tools in a single view.
