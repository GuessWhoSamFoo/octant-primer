# Community

1. Discussions around Octant that are not VMware confidential should happen in the public [#Octant](https://kubernetes.slack.com/app_redirect?channel=CM37M9FCG) slack channel.
2. One cannot assume only VMware employees are maintaining Octant even if that is true at the moment.

The guidelines are described in greater detail inside the [contributing](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/octant/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) documentation. The gist is that short questions should go into the public Slack channel. Longer form discussions should be in Github as the form of an issue or a discussion thread to increase visibility and preserve context over time.
