# Electron

The latest work in Octant are done on Electron. Although the webserver binary will be supported for a few more releases, it will be up for deprecation.

New development is encourage to be done on electron builds whenever possible.

There is a demonstrated demand of a something Octant-like running inside a cluster or inside a VM as a shared web server, but it may be best considered for a different project.

Continued work will optimized for a desktop Kubernetes experience.
