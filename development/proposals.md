# Proposals

[Proposals](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/octant/tree/master/proposals) and [Roadmap](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/octant/blob/master/ROADMAP.md) are the two key pieces of public facing documents besides the readme.

Suggestions for major changes in the project or work requiring coordination of people from multiple roles should be captured in writing. It allows future developers to assess the decisions made and hopefully build upon our work.
